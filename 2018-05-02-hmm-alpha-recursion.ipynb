    "# Inference in discrete state Hidden Markov Models using numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo shows exact inference on a Hidden Markov Model with known, discrete transition and emission distributions that are fixed over time. It does alpha recursion, which is a sum-product algorithm on HMMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is taken from Example 23.3 from [\"Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning\"](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.barber/brml/), and this is more or less a port of the provided Matlab implementation with my commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm trying to understand how my probabilistic graphical modelling class can be represented in code, so I try to go through this painfully slow and show how the `numpy` arrays map to the discrete probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that there's someone moving around a room. You can't see them, but you can hear bumps and creaks from them moving around. You know the probability of someone bumping or creaking at each location in the room. You also know how one moves around the room.\n",
    "Using the sequence of bumps and/or creaks, the goal is to figure out the locations in the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is what I will end up with:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Three sets of 10 images, second row showing a dot moving around a grid, third row showing highlighted area where model thinks the dot is](images/2018-05-02-filtering.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first row represents the bumps/creaks you hear. The second row represents where the person actually is. The third row represents where alpha recursion guesses the person is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HMMs\n",
    "\n",
    "![HMM diagram](images/2018-05-02-hmm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be modeled using a Hidden Markov Model. At each timestep $t$ in the sequence, there's the visible state $v_t$ (the bump/creak combination) and the hidden state $h_t$ (the location in the room.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of *filtering* is to show the probability distribution over the locations in the room at a given timestep $t$ given the bumps/creaks from the current and previous timesteps, $p(h_t\\mid v_{1:t})$. Plotting this distribution at each timestep gives a heatmap of where in the room we think the person is. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, there is a transition distribution $p(h_t \\mid h_{t - 1})$ to show that each hidden state depends on the previous timestep's hidden state. There also is the emission distribution $p(v_t \\mid h_t)$ to show each visible state depends on the corresponding hidden state. There's also the probability of where in the room the person starts, $p(h_1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the notebook shows:\n",
    " - Setting up the known distributions $p(h_1)$, $p(h_t \\mid h_{t - 1})$, and $p(v_t \\mid h_t)$. This is a lot of the notebook!\n",
    " - Generating some data for the locations ($h_{1:t}$) and sounds ($v_{1:t}$) from that distribution.\n",
    " - Finally I get to alpha recursion. I try to predict $h_{1:t}$ based on $v_{1:t}$, $p(h_1)$, $p(h_t \\mid h_{t - 1})$, and $p(v_t \\mid h_t)$."
